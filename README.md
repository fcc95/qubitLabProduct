# Getting Started with React Native CLI

This project was bootstrapped with React Native CLI.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### npm start

Runs the Metro bundler, which is responsible for compiling your JavaScript code and bundling all the dependencies.
Open http://localhost:8081 to view the Metro bundler in the browser.

The Metro bundler will automatically reload if you make edits to your code.
You will also see any lint errors in the terminal.

### npm run android

Builds the Android app and launches it on an Android emulator or connected device.
Make sure you have an Android emulator running or a device connected.

### npm run ios

Builds the iOS app and launches it on the iOS Simulator.
Make sure you have the iOS Simulator installed or a physical device connected.

## npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

## npm run eject

- - Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you canâ€™t go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Metro, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
